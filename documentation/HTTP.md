## Configuration

### Default.json

For each of your EndPoint, the following keys are mandatory:<br/>
    - "rules": this refers to the set of rules files you want to apply to this environment.<br/>
    - "prefix": the prefix is the particle to be placed in front of the environment variables to be quoted [here](#environment).<br/>
    - "METHOD": It's define the way to communicate with the endpoint: "GET", "POST", "DELETE", "PATCH", ....<br/>
    - "URL": destination of the request<br/><br/>

Optional keys to add more detail to your request:<br/>
    - "header": it's a json that collapse all your additional key/value you want. If you want to add AUTHORIZATION please refer to [environment](#environment)<br/>
    - "body": You can pass want ever you want except file<br/><br/>

The following keys are recommended to ensure better readability when re-reading the configuration:<br/>
    - "name": the name refers to the environment concerned by one or more keywords.<br/>
    - "description": the description helps to clarify the name and avoid any possible confusion about the environment concerned.<br/><br/>

Example config for 2 environments:<br/>
![example config for http](../config/demo/http.default.json)

### Environment

You can add authorization to your request but it's not mandatory. However you want it:
```bash
AUTHORIZATION=
```

note that "METHOD" and "URL" can also be set as environment variables instead of in "default.json".
